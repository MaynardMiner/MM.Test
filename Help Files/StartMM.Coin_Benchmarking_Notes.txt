To help users to benchmark-

If a coin can't be benchmarked, or crashes- It writes a note in the "Timeou" folder called "Miner_Coin_Timeout".txt

This should allow you to note issues, and address them...So you don't have to sit in front of miner the whole time. Obviously if you need to recover your benchmarking, you simply just copy/paste your backup data to your stat folder, and there is no need to benchmark all over again. However, make sure you delete all "Miner_Coin_Timeout.txt" files before doing so, or you will have issues loading miner.

I would save backup folder onto a remote site, in case computer crashes.

ALSO

Before continuing, I would advise you to take a long look at wiki. MM.Hash both behaves and operates differently than most script miners, being a hybrid mining system. You will see things happen that may appear weird in comparison to other mining systems.

There are lots of customization options available for using MM.Hash, including dividing miner up, specifying devices for individual miners, changing stat varibles, removing/adding algorithms remotely, and other items which will take a little education to learn. However, learning how these options work can greatly help you to customize MM.Hash to your specific application.
