Arguments & Explanations:

                   -Simple Arguments-

       These arguments must be specified To Run Miner

Argument          Options           Explanation

-GPU_Count1       [1-1000]	    Total number of GPU's for HiveOS. This is needed for miner to determine
				    correct hashrate for each GPU. If you are dividing your miner into seperate
				    device groups, then you must add -GPU_Count2 and -GPU_Count3 for each
				    group respectively. (Stats for other device groups will not show on HiveOS-
				    Not reccommended unless you have to).

-StatsInterval   1-10000           Expression is in seconds. This is time required for miner apps to run
                                    before miner write/re-writes benchmarking. This is not be confused 
                                    with -Interval argument, which is used for when miner begins swithing 
                                    process. leave 1 if you want dynamic benchmarking, and for initial 
                                    benchmarking. 1000 for more smoother benchmarking. 10000 to disable 
                                    benchmarking altogether.

-Currency          [Any]            Fiat Currency Of Your Choice. This is used to calculated your 
                                    profit/day. Only currencies on cryptocompare will work.

-CoinExchange      [Any]            Coin Symbol Of Your Wallet (Will only work for coins on cryptocompare).
                                    This will calculate the coin of your choice profit/day. Good if you 
                                    are mining a coin other than BTC. If not, leave BTC or LTC to see 
                                    hash exchange rates.

-Interval         [1-1000]          Expression is in seconds. Time before miner begins checking pools for 
                                    pricing. Ideal target goal should be miner windows close/open every 
                                    5 minutes. Slower cpus may need to fine tune due to the length of time
                                    needed to search pools and find most profitable coin/algo.

-Location       [US,EUROPE,ASIA]    Locations of pools you wish to mine from, for pools that have multiple
                                    Locations to choose from.

-Auto_Algo      ["Yes" or "No"]     Turns on Auto-Algorithm, for pools that only auto-algo. Select "No" if
                                    using miner for coin-switching only.

-Auto_Coin     ["Yes" or "No"]      Zergpool will mine by coin-switching if set to Yes. If set to No,
				    it will switch by the algorithm. Will only mine coins that can be
				    mined via mc= argument.
                                                            
-Poolname      [MPH,                Current Pools MM.Hash can mine from. Omit or add as desire. can
                zergpool_coin,      only use these pools currently.
		zergpool_algo,
                nicehash,  
                phiphipool,
                hashrefinery,  
                blazepool,
                ahashpool,
		starpool,
		blockmasters,]

-Wallet1      [Wallet Address]      Address of your wallet. By default MM.Hash assumes it to be BTC.
                                    See Advanced arguments to change that.

-PasswordCurrency1  [Symbol]        Symbol of your wallet address, specifically for Wallet1. Most pools
                                    only accept BTC for auto-exchange. See pools for options.                                  

-Proxy        [Address]             If mining by proxy, insert address here. This feature has not been
                                    fully tested. Please report to Developer if you have issues so it
                                    can be worked on.

-Type         [CPU,                 Device groups you wish to mine with. Nvidia has three groups in case
               NVIDIA1,             you wish to divide your GPU devices into seperate groups to assist in
               NVIDIA2,             benchmarking, or to prevent entire miner from becoming inoperable if
               NVIDIA3]             one gpu fails.

-Donate      [Percentage]           Percent you wish to donate daily to support further development. 
                                    Miner remembers when you open or close, so it will not steal 
                                    from you...However it only resets donation switch if miner 
                                    hasn't ran for 24 hours.

-Delay         [0-100000]           Expressed in seconds. When MM.Hash closes miners, to prevent BSOD or
                                    Crashing, MM.Hash delays the openining of new miner windows momentarily.
                                    By default, the delay is set to 1 second. Adding the delay argument
                                    can allow you to increase the delay time before openining new miners,
                                    which can give your gpu's a 'cooldown' time if you desire that preference.

-Benchmark     [0-100000]           Expressed in seconds. Default 0. Sets specific interval time for when coin 
				    is in benchmark mode. Can be used for faster benchmarking. When coin has
				    a set hashrate- Miner will defer to time expressed in -Interval parameter.

-Threshold     [.1 - 100000]	    Expressed in BTC/day. Default is .1. If the total daily profits of a
				    particular algo/coin exceed the -Threshold argument, it will be removed
				    from database calculation. This is to prevent mining on a particular
		                    coin/algorithm in which the pool is having issues with. It only needs
				    to be specified if you wish it to be different than .1 btc/day

Dividing Miner

MM.Hash has the capability of dividing miner into seperate device groups. By default, 
it is set to use Wallet1 & PasswordCurrency1. You can however choose to divide you miner, up to three 
different groups. This is the commands/options you must add to do so:

-Type
 
You can specify more than 1 NVIDIA group to mine with. Options are NVIDIA1,NVIDIA2,NVIDIA3. In 
order to be able to use the arguments for the device group below- You must add to "Type" argument. 
To all three groups for example it would be:

-Type NIVIDIA1,NVIDIA2,NVIDIA3

To use 2 Groups, and Mine with CPU processor would be:

-Type NVIDIA1,NVIDIA2,CPU

For Type
if (Type = NVIDIA1)

-GPUDevices1 = Devices you are using for group for all miners.

You can swap GPUDevices1 for miner specific device groups. Useful for larger mining rigs, where gpu 10+
is expressed differently in each miner:

-CCDevices1 = Devices you are using for group for CCminers. Example: '0,1,2,3'. This must match Type 
"NIVIDIA1".
-EWBFDevices1 = Devices you are using for group for EWBF. EWBF Files must be moved to Miners folder.
-DSTMDevices1 = Devices you are using for group for DSTM.

Lastly you must set your wallet/password info. Here are basic:

-Wallet1 = Wallet for device group 1. BTC works for all pools. See pools to find out if other coins can 
be used. Zergpool in example accepts RVN as exchange.
-PasswordCurrency1 = Wallet Symbol (See Pool For More Details, Must Match Wallet)

Example:

-Type NVIDIA1 -CCDevices1 '0,1,2,3,4,5' -EWBFDevices1 '0 1 2 3 4 5' -Wallet1 1ERWEDAe234wehdshWe -PasswordCurrency1 BTC

or

-Type NVIDIA1 -GPUDevices1 '0,1,2,3,4,5' -Wallet1 1ERWEDAe234wehdshWe -PasswordCurrency1 BTC

for Type
if (Type = NVIDIA2)

-CCDevices2 = Devices you are using for wallet group 2.   (NVIDIA2)
-EWBFDevices2 = Devices you are using for wallet group 2.
-Wallet2 = Wallet for device group 2
-PasswordCurrency2 = Wallet Symbol

If you are using -Type NVIDIA1,NVIDIA2 Example:

-Type NVIDIA1,NVIDIA2 -CCDevices1 '0,1,2' -DSTMDevices1 '0 1 2' -ClayDevices1 '012' -Wallet1 1ERWEDAe234wehdshWe -PasswordCurrency1 BTC -Type NVIDIA2 -CCDevices2 '3,4,5' -DSTM Devices2 '3 4 5 ' -ClayDevices '345' -Wallet2 1aeEdrREglIT45EIWWheee -PasswordCurrency2 BTC

-CCDevices3 = Same as above (group 2) for group 3   (NVIDIA3)
-EWBFDevices = Same as above (group 2)
-Wallet3 = Same as above (group 2)
-PasswordCurrency3 = Same as above (group 2)

Zergpool Wallet And Password

Zergpool gives you the ability to exchange into more than BTC. These options will let you specify a 
certain coin to exchange to for zergpool only. However, you will continue to mine other pools using BTC. 

Rules:
1.) Must be used with Wallet1,Wallet2,Wallet3  
2.) Must be used with PasswordCurrency1, PasswordCurrency2, PasswordCurrency3
3.) Must be use both Zergpoolpassword & ZergpoolWallet
4.) Confirm with zergpool that coin can be auto-traded
5.) Poolname zergpool must be specified

-ZergpoolWallet1 = Wallet for device group 1.
-ZergpoolWallet2 = Wallet for device group 2.
-ZergpoolWallet3 = Wallet for device group 3..
-Zergpoolpassword1 = Wallet Symbol for device group 1.
-Zergpoolpassword2 = Wallet Symbol for device group 2.
-Zergpoolpassword3 = Wallet Symbol for device group 3.

Example of use:

" .. -Poolname blazepool,zpool,nicehash,zergpool -Type NVIDIA1 -Wallet1 1ERWEDAe234wehdshWe -PasswordCurrency1 -ZergpoolWallet1 1RHS234GsasierGHT -Zergpoolpassword1 RVN"

This will tell the miner to mine with BTC for all pools in default device group (device group 1) that 
are not zergpool. However, when the miner switches to zergpool- It will use the Raven Wallet specified.
***************************************
***************************************
Nicehash Mining

Rules:
1.) Must be used with Wallet1,Wallet2,Wallet3
2.) Must be used with PasswordCurrency1, PasswordCurrency2, PasswordCurrency3
3.) Must use only your Nicehash Wallet Address
4.) Must specify nicehash fee you wish to factor into profitability. See nicehash for their fees.
4.) -Poolname nicehash must be specified

Example of use

" ..  -Poolname zergpool,blazepool,zpool,nicehash -Type NVIDIA1 -Wallet1 1ERWEDAe234wehdshWe -PasswordCurrency1 -ZergpoolWallet1 1RHS234GsasierGHT -Zergpoolpassword1 RVN -Nicehash_Wallet1 2Rser43534sSDOIWERH -Nicehash_Fee 2"

This will tell the miner to mine with BTC for all pools that require BTC. For zergpool, it will mine ravencoin. When nicehash is most profitable, it will mine on nicehash with the wallet specified.
**************************
**************************
CPU Mining

CPU mining setup is the same for GPU setup, except the arguments are different to specify CPU use.
If you are using nicehash- It will defer to Nicehash_Wallet1
If you are using zergpool- It will defer to CPU_Wallet

-Type CPU   (Or -Type NVIDIA1,CPU if combining GPU and CPU mining)
-CPUWallet = Wallet to be used for CPU
-CPUcurrency = Password Argument for CPUWallet. Must Match CPU Wallet Address.

Example of use;

" ..-pool zergpool,nicehash -Type NVIDIA1,CPU -Wallet1 1ERWEDAe234wehdshWe -PasswordCurrency1 BTC -CPUWallet 1ERWEDAe234wehdshWe -Nicehash_Wallet1 2Rser43534sSDOIWERH -CPUcurrency BTC"

This will tell miner to use NVIDIA1 with Wallet1 which is BTC, and to use same wallet for CPU which is 
BTC. It will use CPU_Wallet when mining on zergpool, and -Nicehash_Wallet1 when mining on nicehash. 
Both are BTC wallets.
