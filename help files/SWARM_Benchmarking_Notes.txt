To help users to benchmark-

If a coin/aglo can't be benchmarked, or crashes- It writes a note in the "Timeout folder called "Miner_Coin_Timeout".txt

This should allow you to note issues, and address them...So you don't have to sit in front of miner the whole time. Obviously if you need to recover your benchmarking, you simply just copy/paste your backup data to your stat folder, and there is no need to benchmark all over again.

I would save backup folder onto a remote site, in case computer crashes.

ALSO

Before continuing, I would advise you to take a long look at wiki. SWARM both behaves and operates differently than most script miners, being a hybrid mining system. You will see things happen that may appear weird in comparison to other mining systems.

There are lots of customization options available for using SWARM, including dividing miner up, specifying devices for individual miners, changing stat varibles, removing/adding algorithms remotely, and other items which will take a little education to learn. However, learning how these options work can greatly help you to customize SWARM to your specific application.
